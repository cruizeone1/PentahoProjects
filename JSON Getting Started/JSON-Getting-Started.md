# Pentaho Demo – JSON Getting Started

**Objective**  
Provide a hands-on lab for parsing JSON, normalizing nested structures, and persisting to relational targets.

**Outcome & Impact**  
Onboarded new developers quickly; established repeatable patterns for JSON → CSV/warehouse pipelines.

**Technical Steps Taken**  
1. Connected JSON/CSV samples (e.g., `JSON_20190206.csv`, `JSON_20190207.csv`, `City_List_Orig.csv`).  
2. Developed ETL: `JSON_Data_Processing.ktr`, `JSON_to_CSV.ktr`, `Working_JSON_Data_Processing_Lab.ktr`, backups.  
3. Extended with DW enrichment (`Getting Started Extended.ktr`, `Data Enrichment II.ktr`).  
4. Exported simple Mondrian model where ad-hoc pivots helped validation.  
5. Built PUC dashboards for verification; created step-by-step guides; presented demo.
