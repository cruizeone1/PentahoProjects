Attached is an archive of the clickstream Weka files and PDI transformations. 

You'll need to have Weka 3.7.7 and install a couple of packages via Weka's package manager (GUIChooser-->Tools):

1) kfKettle - provides an injection point into the Knowledge Flow for PDI rows

2) jfreechartOffscreenRenderer - for producing the png lift, cumulative gains and precision-recall charts.

If you're using PDI 4.4, then all the necessary Weka PDI plugins should already be included.
